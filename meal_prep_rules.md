# Conceptual Rules for Efficient Meal Prep

These rules adapt professional kitchen practices into a repeatable framework for home and family meal prep. They focus on safety, efficiency, and minimizing waste.

---

## 0. Menu Design Principles

- **Reuse Rule:** Each protein, starch, and veg base must be used in at least 2 meals.
- **Cap on Complexity:** ≤8 unique prep modules per week (proteins, grains, sauces, sides).
- **Protein-First:** Dinners ≥35g protein/adult; lunches ≥25g.
- **Perishables Sequencing:** Use seafood, greens, and delicate produce early week; hardy veg, lentils, and braises later.

## 1. Foundation: Mise en Place

1. **Read & Plan**
   - Review all recipes; identify cross-uses.
   - Build a production schedule working backward from service.
   - Note long-lead prep (defrost T-48h, marinate T-24h).
2. **Organize**
   - Arrange tools, cutting boards, storage containers, and sanitation supplies.
   - Pre-measure/portion ingredients into bowls or sheet pans.
   - Group ingredients in sequence of use.
3. **Workstation Layout**
   - Define prep → cook → storage triangle.
   - Keep raw and cooked zones separate (color-coded boards if possible).

## 2. Batch Cooking Components

- **Proteins:** Cook large versatile batches (roasts, thighs, pulled pork). Portion for reuse.
- **Grains/Starches:** Batch cook rice, quinoa, beans, or pasta; undercook pasta by ~2 minutes for later finishing.
- **Vegetables:** Roast hardy veg in bulk; wash and chop quick-cook veg; group by similar cooking temps.

---

## 3. Temperature & Equipment Management

- **Group by Temp:** Run items requiring the same oven/stovetop settings together.
- **Bottleneck Plan:** Document rack map and burner allocation per 15-min block.
- **Multi-Appliance Use:** Pressure cooker/slow cooker for long braises and grains; oven for bulk roasting; air fryer for crisp reheats.

---

## 4. Time Management

1. **Two-Phase Workflow**
   - **Prep Phase:** Washing, chopping, sauces, marinades.
   - **Assembly Phase:** Final cooking, reheating, garnish.
2. **Task Batching**
   - Knife work in one block.
   - Group cooking methods (roast all veg, then sauté).
3. **Timeboxes**
   - Weekly prep = ≤2h block (Sun) + ≤45m top-up (Wed).

---

## 5. Storage & Holding

- **Cooling:** Shallow pans; vent lids until food ≤70°F within 2h, then cover and chill ≤41°F within 6h total.
- **Portioning:** Uniform 2"-deep containers or flat freezer bags for fast cooling and thawing.
- **Labeling:** Every container marked with _Item • Cooked date • Use-by date • Reheat method_.
- **FIFO:** “Eat next” bin in fridge; always rotate.

---

## 6. Scheduling & Sequencing

- **Work Backward:** Start with long-lead items (braises, roasts), then grains/sauces, finish with fast-cooks and salads.
- **Perishables First:** Plan to use delicate produce within 2–3 days; save roasted roots and beans for late week.
- **Mid-Week Top-Up:** Slot for quick chop/reheat/prep.

---

## 7. Equipment & Layout

- **Essential Tools:** Sheet pans, shallow storage containers, digital thermometers, sharp chef’s knife, large cutting board.
- **Time-Savers:** Food processor, immersion blender, air fryer.
- **Zoning:** Dedicated areas for raw prep, cooked storage, and reheating to reduce cross-contamination.

---

## 8. Quality Control & Feedback

- **Pilot Bite:** Taste test one portion before scaling a new recipe.
- **Consistent Recipes:** Standardize timing and methods; record improvements.
- **Retro Log:** Note what ran long, what sogged, what kids refused. Adjust next cycle.
- **Weekly Change Rule:** Try only 1–2 new adjustments per cycle.

## 9. Rubric for Evaluating Each Week (Score 0–10)

- Reuse Efficiency (≤8 modules, each reused ≥2x) — /3
- Bottleneck Coverage (oven/appliance plan exists) — /2
- Safety & Storage Compliance (cooling, labeling, FIFO) — /2
- Nutrition & Perishables Targets met — /2
- Timeboxes Respected (≤2h + ≤45m) — /1
